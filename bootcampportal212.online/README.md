# Bootcamp Portal

The official repository of the platform for the first Trading212 backend bootcamp.


## Description
The project was created to serve as a place where the participants of the bootcamp can easily access needed information and links so they can save time in their everyday activities.
It also includes a way for the mentors to add new content.

## Features
The platform features a main page where the users can see the modules from the training, news and additional recources. There is also an admin panel where a moderator can perform CRUD operations on the content of the website.
The DB design also allows to easily create new similar programs and integrate them without much hassle and minimal added code.

## Implementation
The frontend part of the application is built using HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap. All of the information is rendered using PHP and is taken from a MYSQL database.

## Installation
All of the code is included in the public_html folder and can be uploaded and hosted on any such service. The db schema is also included in the repo and can be used to create the repo and initiallize it with some data for demo purposes.
