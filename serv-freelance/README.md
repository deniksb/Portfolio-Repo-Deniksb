# Serv Freelance Platform

Serv! is a platform where different types of people can offer their services in a simple and reliable way.


## Description
Serv! is a platform where people of all trades can offer their services in exchange for money. It is also a place where someone in need of a certain skillset can easily find it for the price that suits them. The online platform provides simplicity and reliability, safe payments with Stripe and easy communication between customer and worker.

## Features
Serv! offers the ability to browse, filter and create posts which act as your own personal ad for your services. Name, description, duration and price can be set and also an image that represents your work. 
As a user requests can be made towards service providers which can then be accepted or declined. Once an order is accepted and created the customer and worker can communicate via the messaging system and arrange whatever they need to accomplish their tasks on the platform. Once the work on an order has been completed the user is provided with the option to pay via card using Stripe which is secure and no credit card details are stored on the platform. 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.


## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
